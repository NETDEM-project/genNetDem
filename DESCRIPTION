Description: genNetDem is an R package to generate longitudinal social network and/or capture-recapture datasets with known underlying properties. The functions provided can be split into four broad groups: a) population features; b) survival features; c) social network features; and d) observation features. The package is designed to be modular so that specific components can be used in isolation or user-generated code can be easily integrated to extend its functionality to different ecological or social contexts.
